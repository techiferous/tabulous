= Tabulous

== Description

Tabulous provides an easy way to add tabs to your Rails application.

== Requirements

Tabulous only works with Rails 3.  It has been tested on Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2.
This works with rails 3.1, but I have just tested it by navigating in the browser.
I have just changed the dependency in the gemspec file.

== Usage

Traditionally, implementing tabs in Rails involves adding logic to your views and sprinkling
tab-related code all over your controllers.  Tabulous takes a different approach and
consolidates all of the tab-related code into one configuration file.  Apart from this
configuration file, you just have to call <%= tabs %> and <%= subtabs %> in your view layout(s)
and then create your own CSS styles for the tabs.

To get started, add the this line your Rails application's Gemfile 

  gem 'tabulous', :git => 'git@github.com:andreaslyngstad/tabulous.git'

and install it using:

  bundle install

Then generate the tab file:

  rails generate tabs

This will generate app/tabs/tabulous.rb.  Open the file and configure it to your liking.
You'll notice the code is formatted into a grid.  After you edit the file, run the following rake
task to prettify the code back into a nice grid:

  rake tabs:format

Make sure you call the following view helpers in your layout(s):

  <%= tabs %>
  <%= subtabs %>

The tabs helper will generate markup that looks like this:

  <div id="tabs">
    <ul>
      <li class="active enabled"><span class="tab">Explanation</span></li>
      <li class="inactive enabled"><a href="/galaxies/elliptical_galaxies" class="tab">Galaxies</a></li>
      <li class="inactive enabled"><a href="/exoplanets" class="tab">Planets</a></li>
      <li class="inactive enabled"><a href="/stars" class="tab">Stars</a></li>
      <li class="inactive disabled"><span class="tab">Asteroids</span></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

And the subtabs helper will generate markup that looks like this:

  <div id="subtabs">
    <ul>
      <li class="active enabled"><span class="tab">Exoplanets</span></li>
      <li class="inactive enabled"><a href="/rogue_planets" class="tab">Rogue Planets</a></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

Tabulous will start you off with some CSS scaffolding but you'll eventually want to create your own
CSS. 

== Examples

There is a tutorial at http://techiferous.com/2011/03/tutorial-for-adding-tabs-to-rails-using-tabulous/

Also, look in this gem's test/applications directory to find working example applications.
Look at their app/tabs/tabulous.rb and app/layouts/application.html.erb files.

== Contributing

Developers are encouraged to contribute ideas or code.

To make code changes:

* First, check out this gem's code from github.
* Next, type bundle install in tabulous's directory.  This will install any gems you need
  for developing tabulous.
* Then go to each directory in test/applications and type bundle install.  This makes sure
  the test applications have the gems that they need to run.
* To save you the effort of having to create and migrate databases for each test application,
  I've committed the sqlite databases of each test application to the repository.
* Now go to tabulous's directory and type rake test.  If everything has been installed
  properly, all of the tests will pass.    
* Now you should be all set to code.

Please send me a message if you find any confusing or incorrect documentation in tabulous or if
you encounter any bugs.  Thank you and enjoy!
