# Tabulous

[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/techiferous/tabulous.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/techiferous/tabulous)

Tabulous provides an easy way to add tabs to your Rails application.

## Requirements

Tabulous officially supports Rails 5.0, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0 and MRI Ruby 2.3, 2.2, 2.1 and 2.0.

Tabulous should also work with Rails 3.2, 3.1, 3.0 and MRI Ruby 1.9 but automated tests to verify this have been removed.

Tabulous definitely does not work with Ruby 1.8.
